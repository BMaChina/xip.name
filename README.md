A simple wildcard DNS inspired by [xip.io](http://xip.io/)

```bash
        10.0.0.1.xip.name  resolves to  10.0.0.1
    www.10.0.0.2.xip.name  resolves to  10.0.0.2
    foo.10.0.0.3.xip.name  resolves to  10.0.0.3
bar.baz.10.0.0.4.xip.name  resolves to  10.0.0.4
```

### How does it work?

xip.name runs a custom DNS server which extracts any IP address found
in the requested domain name and sends it back in the response.


### Does it cost anything to use xip.name?

No, but you are welcome to donate if you find the service useful.
